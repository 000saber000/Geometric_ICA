# Repository for Signal Processing and Source Separation

Welcome to this repository dedicated to signal processing and source separation techniques! Here, you'll find a collection of Jupyter Notebook files covering various methods, including Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Laccume algorithms, and more.

## Contents:

- **Geometric_ICA.ipynb**: Notebook exploring a geometric approach for separating signals using ICA.
- **Laccume.ipynb**: Notebook implementing the Laccume algorithm for source separation.
- *Additional notebooks*: Explore more techniques for signal processing and source separation.

# Geometric_ICA
A Geometric Approach for Separating Several Signals
in this work, we want to use a geometric approach to separate two signals that are statistically independent.
